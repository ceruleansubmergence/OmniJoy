Rev 1 Changelog:

Fixes:

- Fixed footprint problems found with Rev 0
  - Button layout
  - Inverted diode footprint
- Fixed circuit connection problems found with Rev 0
  - Tied MCP73871 CE line to Vin
  - Grounded unused data lines on the TFT display


Changes:

- Connected display via DPI/RGB interface
- Increased board dimensions to match case dimensions
- Moved on/off switch in order to remove interference with Pi HDMI connector and moved Pi to make HDMI more accessible
- Adjusted component placement to simplify case construction
- Replaced level converter IC with FET level converters
- Changed boost supply to MIC2253 from LT1935
- Changed touch screen controller to STMPE811 from TSC2046 to switch from SPI to I2C (needed for DPI/RGB Interface)
- Moved battery voltage and current sensing to STMPE811
- Relocated all parts that were below the TFT display
- Increased keepout area below positive battery terminals
- Changed from stereo audio to mono as IO was needed for other functions
- Removed unneeded connection to INTB on MCP23S17
- Removed right/left handed navigation switch/button layout
- Adjusted buttons on face to be more "normal"


Additions:

- Added footprint for optional CTS mini-joystick in place of PSP1000.
- Increased circuit protection by adding
  - TVS on micro-USB charge connector
  - Self-reseting fuses on each battery
- Added electrolytic capacitor near USB-A to reduce in-rush problems with USB bus
- Added current sensing to battery lines using INA181A
  - Unidirectional by default
  - Bidirectional component footprints placed but not populated and likely unnecessary
- Added dedicated CPPM output header
- Added Mosfet power protection and switching (on/off circuit)
- Added power indicator LED
- Added additional components needed to restore functionality lost from switch to DPI/RGB mode:
  - CP2120 SPI to I2C bridge to provide "native" I2C and GPIO
    - 8 GPIO broken out to header (not populated)
  - PCA9685 LED/PWM Driver connected to:
    - TFT Backlight
    - 2 RGB LED footprints (not populated)
    - 3 standard LED footprints (not populated)
    - 8 pin header connected to power and 6 PWM spares (not populated)
  - Footprint for I2C UART (SC16IS750IBS) with support components
    - Not to be populated for budgetary reasons.  Potential "stretch" goal.
    - Serial lines connected to pin header (RXD, TXT, RTS, CTS, GND, 3.3V)
    - Spare GPIO connected to pin header
    - Connected to Arduino to allow for self-programming of on-board Arduino.
- Added footprint for T1 (3mm) IR LED and drive FET for potential LIRC use.
  - Used to make OmniJoy a universal infrared remote control (i.e. TVs, etc)
  - Not to be populated for budgetary reasons.  Potential "stretch" goal.
- Added footprints for two buttons on the back of the board.
  - Not to be populated.  Placed for testing purposes.
